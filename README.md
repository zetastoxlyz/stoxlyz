## Demo Credentials

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `super@stoxlyz.id` | `super123` | Super Admin |
| `budi@stoxlyz.id` | `password123` | Admin |
| `demo@stoxlyz.id` | `demo123` | User |

Role-based access:

- **User** — access to all public pages (home, watchlist, news, indicators, stocks, profile, settings)
- **Admin** — same as User + `/admin` panel
- **Super Admin** — same as Admin (currently identical in the UI)

> The admin panel is at `/admin`, not `/superadmin`.

## Deployment

Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `master` via GitHub Actions. The workflow runs `npm run generate` and publishes `.output/public/` to the `gh-pages` environment.
